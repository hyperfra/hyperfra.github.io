    " If unequal at any moment, competition equalizes them, and the manner in which this is done is by an adjustment\n",
    " of the value. If the demand increases, the value rises; if the demand diminishes, the value falls;\n",
    " again, if the supply falls off, the value rises; and falls, if the supply is increased.\n",
    " The rise or the fall continues until the demand and supply are again equal to one another:\n",
    " and the value which a commodity will bring in any market is no other than the value which, in that market,\n",
    " gives a demand just sufficient to carry off the existing or expected supply.\n",

    "  This law of International Values is but an extension of the more general law of Value,\n",
    "  which we called the Equation of Supply and Demand. We have seen that the value of a\n",
    "  commodity always so adjusts itself as to bring the demand to the exact level of the supply.\n",
    "  But all trade, either between nations or individuals, is an interchange of commodities,\n",
    "  in which the things that they respectively have to sell constitute also their means of purchase:\n",
    "  the supply brought by the one constitutes his demand for what is brought by the other.\n",
    "   So that supply and demand are but another expression for **reciprocal demand**;\n",
    "  and to say that value will adjust itself so as to equalize demand with supply, is, in fact, to say that it will adjust itself so as to equalize the demand on one side with the demand on the other.\n",

    "that we are always on the verge of it, and that if we have not reached it long ago,\n",
